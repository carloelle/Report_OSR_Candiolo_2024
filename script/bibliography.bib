	abstract = {Stromal content heavily impacts the transcriptional classification of colorectal cancer ({CRC}), with clinical and biological implications. Lineage-dependent stromal transcriptional components could therefore dominate over more subtle expression traits inherent to cancer cells. Since in patient-derived xenografts ({PDXs}) stromal cells of the human tumour are substituted by murine counterparts, here we deploy human-specific expression profiling of {CRC} {PDXs} to assess cancer-cell intrinsic transcriptional features. Through this approach, we identify five {CRC} intrinsic subtypes ({CRIS}) endowed with distinctive molecular, functional and phenotypic peculiarities: (i) {CRIS}-A: mucinous, glycolytic, enriched for microsatellite instability or {KRAS} mutations; (ii) {CRIS}-B: {TGF}-β pathway activity, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, poor prognosis; (iii) {CRIS}-C: elevated {EGFR} signalling, sensitivity to {EGFR} inhibitors; (iv) {CRIS}-D: {WNT} activation, {IGF}2 gene overexpression and amplification; and (v) {CRIS}-E: Paneth cell-like phenotype, {TP}53 mutations. {CRIS} subtypes successfully categorize independent sets of primary and metastatic {CRCs}, with limited overlap on existing transcriptional classes and unprecedented predictive and prognostic performances.},

To understand this cross-talk, we analyzed the transcriptome of 91,103 unsorted single cells from 23 Korean and 6 Belgian patients. Cancer cells displayed transcriptional features reminiscent of normal differentiation programs, and genetic alterations that apparently fostered immunosuppressive microenvironments directed by regulatory T cells, myofibroblasts and myeloid cells. Intercellular network reconstruction supported the association between cancer cell signatures and specific stromal or immune cell populations. Our collective view of the cellular landscape and intercellular interactions in colorectal cancer provide mechanistic information for the design of efficient immuno-oncology treatment strategies.},

	abstract = {Large single-cell atlases are now routinely generated to serve as references for analysis of smaller-scale studies. Yet learning from reference data is complicated by batch effects between datasets, limited availability of computational resources and sharing restrictions on raw data. Here we introduce a deep learning strategy for mapping query datasets on top of a reference called single-cell architectural surgery ({scArches}). {scArches} uses transfer learning and parameter optimization to enable efficient, decentralized, iterative reference building and contextualization of new datasets with existing references without sharing raw data. Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, immune and whole-organism atlases, we show that {scArches} preserves biological state information while removing batch effects, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters than de novo integration. {scArches} generalizes to multimodal reference mapping, allowing imputation of missing modalities. Finally, {scArches} retains coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) disease variation when mapping to a healthy reference, enabling the discovery of disease-specific cell states. {scArches} will facilitate collaborative projects by enabling iterative construction, updating, sharing and efficient use of reference atlases.},

Despite the availability of rich datasets and their continued growth, current single-cell models are unable to fully capitalize on the information they contain. Transformers have become the architecture of choice for foundation models in other domains owing to their ability to generalize to heterogeneous, large-scale datasets. Thus, the question arises of whether transformers could set off a similar shift in the field of single-cell modeling. Here we first describe the transformer architecture and its single-cell adaptations and then present a comprehensive review of the existing applications of transformers in single-cell analysis and critically discuss their future potential for single-cell biology. By studying limitations and technical challenges, we aim to provide a structured outlook for future research directions at the intersection of machine learning and single-cell biology.},

This subtype of fibroblasts is linked to T cell and macrophage suppression and leads to increased cancer cell growth in 3D co-culture assays. Furthermore, both a fibroblast-specific {IL}1R1 knockout and {IL}-1 receptor antagonist Anakinra administration reduce tumor growth in vivo. This is accompanied by reduced intratumoral Th17 cell infiltration. Accordingly, {CRC} patients who present with {IL}1R1-expressing cancer-associated-fibroblasts ({CAFs}), also display elevated levels of immune exhaustion markers, as well as an increased Th17 score and an overall worse survival.

Based on {RNA} sequencing of multiple patient-derived xenograft models, {EMT}-related gene expression was enriched in the stroma versus parenchyma. {EMT}-related markers were predominantly expressed by cancer-associated fibroblasts ({CAFs}), cells of mesenchymal origin which produce a variety of matrix proteins and growth factors. Scores derived from a 3-gene {CAF} transcriptional signature ({COL}1A1, {COL}1A2, {COL}3A1) were sufficient to reproduce association between {EMT}-related markers and disease prognosis. Our results suggest that {CAFs} are the primary source of {EMT} signaling and have potential roles as biomarkers and targets for immuno-oncology therapies.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Gastrointestinal ({GI}) tumors are a significant global health threat, with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Exosomes contain various biologically active molecules like nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids and can serve as messengers for intercellular communication. They play critical roles in the exchange of information between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment ({TME}). The {TME} consists of mesenchymal cells and components of the extracellular matrix ({ECM}), with fibroblasts being the most abundant cell type in the tumor mesenchyme. Cancer-associated fibroblasts ({CAFs}) are derived from normal fibroblasts and mesenchymal stem cells that are activated in the {TME}. {CAFs} can secrete exosomes to modulate cell proliferation, invasion, migration, drug resistance, and other biological processes in tumors. Additionally, tumor cells can manipulate the function and behavior of fibroblasts through direct cell-cell interactions. This review provides a summary of the intercellular crosstalk between {GI} tumor cells and {CAFs} through exosomes, along with potential underlying mechanisms.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Cancer-associated fibroblasts ({CAFs}), the main stromal component of the tumor microenvironment ({TME}), play multifaceted roles in cancer progression through paracrine signaling, exosome transfer, and cell interactions. Attractively, recent evidence indicates that {CAFs} can modulate various forms of regulated cell death ({RCD}) in adjacent tumor cells, thus involving cancer proliferation, therapy resistance, and immune exclusion. Here, we present a brief introduction to {CAFs} and basic knowledge of {RCD}, including apoptosis, autophagy, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis. In addition, we further summarize the different types of {RCD} in tumors that are mediated by {CAFs}, as well as the effects of these modes of {RCD} on {CAFs}. This review will deepen our understanding of the interactions between {CAFs} and {RCD} and might offer novel therapeutic avenues for future cancer treatments.},

To define {CAF} phenotypes, we analyse a single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) dataset of over 16,000 stromal cells from tumours of 14 breast cancer patients, based on which we define and functionally annotate nine {CAF} phenotypes and one class of pericytes. We validate this classification system in four additional cancer types and use highly multiplexed imaging mass cytometry on matched breast cancer samples to confirm our defined {CAF} phenotypes at the protein level and to analyse their spatial distribution within tumours. This general {CAF} classification scheme will allow comparison of {CAF} phenotypes across studies, facilitate analysis of their functional roles, and potentially guide development of new treatment strategies in the future.},

	abstract = {The paradigm for macrophage characterization has evolved from the simple M1/M2 dichotomy to a more complex model that encompasses the broad spectrum of macrophage phenotypic diversity, due to differences in ontogeny and/or local stimuli. We currently lack an in-depth pan-cancer single cell {RNA}-seq ({scRNAseq}) atlas of tumour-associated macrophages ({TAMs}) that fully captures this complexity. In addition, an increased understanding of macrophage diversity could help to explain the variable responses of cancer patients to immunotherapy. Our atlas includes well established macrophage subsets as well as a number of additional ones. We associate macrophage composition with tumour phenotype and show macrophage subsets can vary between primary and metastatic tumours growing in sites like the liver. We also examine macrophage-T cell functional cross talk and identify two subsets of {TAMs} associated with T cell activation. Analysis of {TAM} signatures in a large cohort of immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated patients ({CPI}1000 + ) identify multiple {TAM} subsets associated with response, including the presence of a subset of {TAMs} that upregulate collagen-related genes. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our data as a resource and reference atlas for mapping of novel macrophage datasets using projection. Overall, these advances represent an important step in both macrophage classification and overcoming resistance to immunotherapies in cancer.},
